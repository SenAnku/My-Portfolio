    <h1>SdK Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to SdKMusiq Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>BIO</h3>

    <p>SdK has no fear breaking into new ground. Hailing from a humble Swazi background, SdK has been drawn to Electronic music ever since the South African music scene took advantage of the Music Compilation business that attracted music from mainly Germany with the likes of Âme and Stimming playing a key role in his Sound. 

        A decade later, SdK’s sound has evolved and still is after delving into music production and gaining so much understanding since he moved to Berlin three years ago.</p>
